31  Modifier. See discussion below.


- Some conditions take a second parameter from a following 0 condition.
- An argument of 230 seems to mean "the noun object", the object that matches the noun of the command, at least when the argument represents an object.
- For condition 28, <arg 230> means <arg 2> is the first noun and <arg 231> means <arg 2> is the second noun.



Condition 31, modifier


if arg is 1 (or 8?), the conditions are ORed rather than ANDed, so that only one of
them has to be true for the action to fire.

Is arg 6: left parenthesis "("?
Is arg 7: right parenthesis ")"?
If arg is 0, ORing is switched off?
If arg is 4, negate all the following conditions.
If arg is 3, negate a single condition.
Arg 9? Only seen before condition 29, DICTWORD.


There are several places in Buckaroo Banzai where this pattern (numbers in
parentheses are arguments to condition 31, letters are other conditions)

	(8) (6) (0)  A B  (7) (6)  C D  (1) (7) (0)  E F G ...

is used to mean IF ((A AND B) OR (C AND D)) AND E AND F AND G ...


In Questprobe 2, the pattern

	(8)  A  B  (1)  C

means IF (A AND B) OR (C)
